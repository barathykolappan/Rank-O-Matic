, an oxford college is to examine its contribution to creating and maintaining britain’s colonial empire, in a pioneering effort to crowdsource and “decolonialise” its own imperialist past., st john’s college is advertising for a new academic post whose appointee will work on a research project named st john’s and the colonial past, alongside prof william whyte, the college’s vice-president and professor of social and architectural history at oxford., the college said the post would be unique within oxbridge as an effort to investigate its own history, including the education of both apologists and critics of the empire, and hopes it will “set the standard for future work in other institutions”., the job application specifically highlights the recent controversy over the rhodes must fall campaign which began in south africa and spread to oxford, due to the financial links between oriel college and its imperialist benefactor and alumnus cecil rhodes. the campaign is calling for the removal of a statue of rhodes at the college., “the drive to ‘decolonise the university’ or, at any rate, to think through the implications of institutional involvement in the imperial projects of the past – is now a global business,” the college said in announcing the post. “as yet, however, no college in oxford or cambridge has seriously undertaken research into its involvement in colonialism., “this project will explore connections between the college and colonialism, uncovering benefactions to st john’s and the alumni who served in the empire. it will also investigate the monuments, objects, pictures, buildings that evoke the colonial past.”, the appointment is for a full-time two-year position as a research assistant, with applicants expected to have a doctorate or similar postgraduate qualification., unusually for an oxbridge academic post, the job specification says expertise in crowdsourcing is “highly desirable” to feed into reports and workshops on the college’s past, including those alumni who benefited from its colonial links., “although, unlike the universities of the us, we believe that the colleges of oxford did not own enslaved people, several undoubtedly benefitted from the largesse of those who did,” the application states., “many of the objects displayed in university museums and some of those owned by the colleges had their origins essentially as loot, stolen from their indigenous owners., “oxford in general helped to educate and train colonial administrators; missionaries; apologists for and critics of empire; and significant leaders and creators of newly independent states.”, the researcher is expected to investigate the connections between the college and colonialism, including donations to st john’s from the alumni who served in the empire. one result is to be a report on st john’s colonial past, followed by a series of workshops to discuss the findings and plan the college’s responses., the post is to be funded by the college. st john’s is the wealthiest oxford college measured by endowments, with more than £500m in assets. its former students include tony blair., last year oxford’s all souls college added a memorial plaque commemorating the slaves who worked on plantations in barbados. the funds from the plantation were left to the college by a former fellow and were used to build the college’s library.]

more than £30,000 a year in some cases., but a spokeswoman for oxford said its overseas student intake had not been influenced by "the fees they may bring with them". , there is intense competition for oxford and cambridge places and there has been much controversy about fair access and social mobility., there have been calls for more places for disadvantaged youngsters, as well as ethnic minority students and white working-class youngsters., while such arguments have continued about widening opportunities, the total number of uk students being awarded places at oxbridge has been reducing., there were about 1,200 fewer uk undergraduates in 2017-18 compared with a decade before - with about 11,300 in oxford and 12,150 in cambridge taking undergraduate degree courses, even though more have applied for places., the figures show there were about 720 fewer uk undergraduate students at oxford university in 2017-18 compared with 2007-08., at cambridge, the numbers have fallen by about 480 students across the decade., but the numbers of overseas students, both eu and non-eu, have climbed sharply, according to the data from hesa, the official statistics body for higher education., in postgraduate courses at cambridge, there are now more overseas students than uk., sir peter lampl, chairman of the sutton trust social mobility charity, said the figures showed the need for the universities to put "widening access at the heart of their admissions policies"., "oxford and cambridge attract many international students, but they must ensure that their student body is balanced., "this means letting in uk and international students based on ability and not on ability to pay," said sir peter., a university of oxford spokeswoman said the same entry standards applied to all students, uk or overseas, based on "academic talent and ability alone" - and uk applicants had a higher rate of success than those from overseas., she said: "places to study are won by demonstrating academic potential through open competition, following the same rigorous application and admission process.", a spokesman for the university of cambridge said: "applications from international students for undergraduate courses have increased by 56% over the period, which means uk students find themselves in a competitive field."  , nick hillman, director of the higher education policy institute, said the reduction in uk student numbers at oxford and cambridge was the "sad but inevitable consequence" of the universities becoming more international but not adding places., "in those circumstances, something has to give and it seems to be places for home students," he says., mr hillman says if the universities do not want to "squeeze out" uk students they need to "bite the bullet and accept more expansion"., the hesa figures also show how other leading universities have been expanding their undergraduate intake much more than oxford and cambridge., university college london has expanded by 65%, bristol by 41% and exeter by 74%., the office for students (ofs), the regulator for higher education, wants more young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to go to university., but the watchdog says this could require a significant increase in places., if all young people went to university at the rate of the richest 20%, says the ofs, it would mean having to double the number of places in russell group universities., the hesa figures also show an even more dramatic drop in adult and continuing education., in cambridge, if people taking certificate and diploma courses were included alongside those on undergraduate degree courses, the overall fall in uk students would be about 29% over the decade., both oxford and cambridge have run extensive outreach projects to attract a wider range of students., an oxford spokeswoman said the university was committed to becoming "more open and diverse", with more ethnic minority and students from deprived areas., "sustaining excellence requires diversity, and our commitment to achieving this balance, and making oxford more reflective of modern society, includes reaching out to and selecting, the best talent from all over the world," she said., a university of cambridge spokesman said that despite the pressure on places, including from overseas, the university has widened access, including accepting rising numbers of state school pupils., "the university has made significant progress in all its widening participation measures over the same period. the university accepts students on merit, regardless of their background," he said., the islamic state group remains a threat despite the fall of its final territory, president trump says., have you been getting these songs wrong?, what happens to your body in extreme heat?]

, oxford and cambridge universities are teaching nearly 1,000 fewer british undergraduates than they were five years ago, despite spending millions of pounds on programmes designed to widen participation and improve access for disadvantaged uk applicants., figures from the higher education statistics agency have shown that oxford and cambridge are almost alone among the competitive british universities in failing to expand their intake of domestic undergraduates while slowly increasing the proportion of sought-after places going to eu and international students., but the two ancient universities defended their record, saying british applicants were far more likely to win admission as undergraduates than those from overseas, despite sharp increases in the numbers of applicants of all nationalities with the necessary grades., oxford said its undergraduate makeup was part of its mission to attract and educate the most talented students from across the world. “we are committed to our role in broadening participation in higher education and doing what it takes to make the university more open and diverse, and are making headway with this work,” a university spokesperson said. “black and ethnic minority students now make up more than 18% of our undergraduate intake, while for the second year in a row more students than ever before have come to oxford from deprived areas of the uk.”, a spokesperson for cambridge said: “the university has made significant progress in all its widening participation measures over the same period. the university accepts students on merit, regardless of their background.”, figures supplied by oxford showed that uk applicants are far more likely to be offered a place compared with their eu and non-eu peers. nearly one in four uk applicants – 23% - were made an offer, compared with one in 10 non-eu applicants and one in eight eu applicants., but critics including the sutton trust and the labour party argued that oxbridge’s priority should be to educate talented uk applicants, given the huge number of qualified applicants the two universities attract domestically., “our world-class universities should be there for all of us, not just the wealthiest and privileged, and urgent action is clearly needed to ensure they are open to talented students regardless of their background,” said angela rayner, the shadow education secretary., the figures for the 2017-18 academic year show that cambridge had 12,155 first degree students , just 295 more than five years earlier. of those, 9,365 were from the uk, 245 fewer than in 2012-13., the combined number of eu and other international undergraduates taking first degrees at cambridge in the same period rose by 545 to 2,790, with most of the increase coming from 420 additional international students, including many from china., oxford showed similar changes, with 420 more international students and 400 fewer british undergraduates in the same five years., figures first published by the bbc show that cambridge has reduced the number of british undergraduates by 480 since 2007-08, while oxford has reduced its intake by more than 700 in the same decade. in contrast, british universities such as bristol and exeter have increased their uk undergraduate numbers by more than 50%., an indication of oxbridge’s strong international standing came in the publication of the latest qs world university rankings by subject, which showed oxford was the highest-performing british university by taking five of the top places., oxford was named the best university in the world for english language and literature, pharmacy and pharmacology, archaeology, anthropology and geography, while cambridge took the no 1 spot for the study of anatomy and physiology., overall, the latest rankings were positive for british universities, which secured the top spot in 13 out of 48 subject areas this year, up from 10 last year., university college london took the top spot for education and the study of architecture and the built environment; sussex for development studies; the royal college of art for art and design; loughborough for sports-related subjects; the royal veterinary college for veterinary science, and the london school of economics for social policy and administration., ben sowter, a director of research at qs, said: “the research data used to compile this edition was collected between 2013 and 2018, and the impact that our imminent exit from the eu will have on uk performance is still unknown.”, the us leads the qs rankings by a considerable margin, with the uk in second place, but qs says america’s higher education performance is faltering, with the number of top rankings at subject level down from 34 last year to 28 this year., • this article was amended on 28 february 2019. an earlier version quoted figures for cambridge of “12,155 first year students for first degrees”. the figures are for all students doing first degrees, not just those in their first year.]

[university hospitals has entered into a multiyear affiliation with the university of oxford to establish a global center for rare diseases, bringing together the capabilities, resources and expertise of both institutions in hopes of delivering new treatments for rare diseases., headquartered in both cleveland and oxford, the oxford-harrington rare disease centre will set the science and innovation agenda to support breakthroughs across the u.k. and u.s. with the greatest chance for clinical impact, according to a news release., "this is a wonderful example of the synergy in science and innovation that is needed to move discovery forward, and it is gratifying to see our institutions in cleveland and oxford combine their strengths to this end," uh ceo thomas f. zenty iii said in a prepared statement., more than 350 million people in the world, about half of them children, live with a rare disease. therapeutic options are lacking for the roughly 7,000 known rare diseases and new diseases are constantly being discovered, according to the release. most rare diseases are genetic, meaning they are present throughout a person's life., only 5% of rare diseases have treatment approved by the u.s. food and drug administration, with similar estimates for treatments approved by the european medicine agency, according to the release., "advancing breakthroughs in rare diseases will require bold, new approaches that can overcome scientific challenges and create new medicines," said dr. jonathan s. stamler, president of harrington discovery institute and reitman family distinguished chair of cardiovascular innovation at uh and case western reserve university school of medicine, in a prepared statement. "this affiliation represents a commitment to patients first and a tremendous opportunity to improve the health and outcomes of those living with a rare disease.", established in 2012, the oxford rare disease initiative is a collaboration between the university of oxford and the oxford university hospitals trust, which provides the opportunity to combine preclinical and clinical expertise in areas including neurology, inflammation and immunology, hematology, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and has created an extensive rare-disease network, according to the release., also founded in 2012, harrington discovery institute — part of the harrington project for discovery &amp; development — aims to advance scientific discoveries over the drug development's "valley of death" — the stage when a new discovery is seen as promising but is insufficiently validated to attract the funding needed for clinical trials. the institute has supported more than 100 drugs-in-the-making across disease areas and academic institutions, focusing on diseases where unmet need is greatest., "our partnership with harrington discovery institute recognizes the combined experience needed in world-class science and drug development if we are to change the rare-disease landscape in a meaningful way — and oxford is committed to doing so through this unique, open model supporting the most impactful innovation throughout the u.k.," said sir john bell, regius professor of medicine at oxford, in a prepared statement., the new center is supported in part by a grant from the cleveland foundation, according to the release., "this is a phenomenal opportunity for cleveland to further distinguish itself as a leader in biomedical innovation," said cleveland foundation president and ceo ronn richard in a prepared statement.

[utc, , , the creative destruction lab is going global., the seed-stage accelerator developed at the university of toronto’s rotman school of management has struck a deal with the university of oxford’s saïd business school to bring its unique startup-building concept to entrepreneurs on the other side of the pond., once up and running, cdl-oxford will become the seventh location in cdl’s network after the program opened at new york university’s stern school of business last year., ajay agrawal, cdl’s founder and a rotman professor of strategic management, said the entire cdl network – which also includes locations at business schools in vancouver, calgary, montreal and halifax – is poised to reap the benefits of having other world-class institutions like nyu and oxford in the mix. , “what we're trying to do is identify people who are the best in the world,” he said. “they're getting our model, but we're getting connectivity and flows of people and capital into canada.”, first launched at rotman in 2012, cdl was created to solve what agrawal refers to as a “failure in the market for judgment.” he got the idea after noting that one of the key benefits afforded startups in places like silicon valley is a large network of seasoned tech executives, venture capitalists and other players who can offer budding entrepreneurs guidance and advice., cdl seeks to replicate the environment with a focus on scalable science- and technology-based ventures. the nine-month program taps a diverse array of experts, from scientists to investors, and requires entrepreneurs to meet clearly defined objectives. cdl also involves mba students, providing the startups with management expertise and students with real-life business problems to solve., the cdl concept was later expanded to business schools across canada., “the thing about the creative destruction lab that i think is unique is how it co-ordinates both across disciplines – for example, we have physicists in the same room as electrical engineers, business school students and economists – and also across the town-and-gown divide,” agrawal says., “so the entrepreneur walks into the room and receives input from a wide range of skill sets.”, so far, the cdl network has helped build startups that are collectively worth $3.4 billion in equity value., thomas hellmann, a professor at oxford’s saïd business school, called the cdl formula “very impressive” and said it made more sense for the saïd school to use an established entrepreneurship model than to invent a new one., “we're very enthusiastic about the model,” hellmann said. “in terms of big picture, this is trying to create a learning community that sits about between the university and commercial world., “each of the participants have their own motivations, but bringing them together in a way that's actually interesting for each of them is what creates the magic.”, three of those participants will be the first three founding partners at cdl-oxford: patrick pichette, a former chief financial officer at google who works with cdl-montreal through his venture capital firm inovia capital; john mccall macbain, a canadian businessman and philanthropist who founded trader classified media; and peter davies, a senior partner at investment management firm lansdowne partners and current chair of oxford sciences innovation. , hellmann, who has been tracking cdl since its inception, said cdl-oxford will start off with a focus on artificial intelligence-based startups, but has plans to expand into other areas. cdl-oxford will begin taking applications for its first cohort later this year., though agrawal never set out to build a global cdl network, he said expanding the concept to more than a half dozen locations creates more opportunities for cdl’s entrepreneurs. , “it has enabled us to match scientific discoveries and commercial applications that often are not co-located,” he said., he cites the example of validere, a startup at cdl-toronto with an “optical liquid fingerprinting” technology developed at harvard university that it planned to use to identify fraudulent perfumes. but after cdl’s fellows found the business case underwhelming, they were directed to cdl-calgary and the oil and gas industry., fast- forward to 2019 and validere now offers a real-time oil-testing service and has offices in calgary, houston and toronto. it raised $7 million from investors last fall., share this page,

, ai experts like geoff hinton, nick bostrom, and william tunstall-pedoe have all offered mentoring to students on cdl programs. , since leaving google in 2015, pichette has become a venture capital investor at inovia capital, where he's a general partner. he's now looking to back the next google's of the world. earlier this month, pichette told media that europe has the potential to build these $100 billion businesses. , pichette is also the incoming chairman of oxford sciences innovation, an organisation that aims to take oxford’s best ideas to the world. the organisation is investing over £580 million the math, physical, life sciences, medical sciences, computer sciences and engineering divisions of oxford university. it's being funded in part by google's venture capital arm, google ventures, or gv as it's known today. , professor peter tufano, dean of saïd business school, said: "with cdl we are taking the next step to support world-class scientific research and innovation across the uk and europe. this programme helps business and technical founders overcome the challenges of developing early-stage ventures into large-scale profitable organisations, by providing outstanding guidance on mission-critical aspects such as developing a commercial strategy, hiring the right people, and securing funding.", chris skidmore, the uk science and innovation minister, added: "the opportunities of artificial intelligence are endless and current innovations are already having a profound effect on our lives – from having a personal assistant on your mobile phone to websites suggesting new films you’d be interested in., "in our modern industrial strategy, we have recognised the value ai can add to our economy, creating the high skilled jobs of the future and boosting our productivity in every part of the uk. this innovative hub – the first in europe – will help our start-ups get the support they need to take their ideas to market and scale up their businesses.",  , you can follow sam shead on twitter: @sam_l_shead., i cover artificial intelligence and google deepmind. in previous roles i’ve written about tech policy, european startups, the gig economy, and venture capital. today i’m...]

, oxford and cambridge universities are teaching nearly 1,000 fewer british undergraduates than they were five years ago, despite spending millions of pounds on programmes designed to widen participation and improve access for disadvantaged uk applicants., figures from the higher education statistics agency have shown that oxford and cambridge are almost alone among the competitive british universities in failing to expand their intake of domestic undergraduates while slowly increasing the proportion of sought-after places going to eu and international students., but the two ancient universities defended their record, saying british applicants were far more likely to win admission as undergraduates than those from overseas, despite sharp increases in the numbers of applicants of all nationalities with the necessary grades., oxford said its undergraduate makeup was part of its mission to attract and educate the most talented students from across the world. “we are committed to our role in broadening participation in higher education and doing what it takes to make the university more open and diverse, and are making headway with this work,” a university spokesperson said. “black and ethnic minority students now make up more than 18% of our undergraduate intake, while for the second year in a row more students than ever before have come to oxford from deprived areas of the uk.”, a spokesperson for cambridge said: “the university has made significant progress in all its widening participation measures over the same period. the university accepts students on merit, regardless of their background.”, figures supplied by oxford showed that uk applicants are far more likely to be offered a place compared with their eu and non-eu peers. nearly one in four uk applicants – 23% - were made an offer, compared with one in 10 non-eu applicants and one in eight eu applicants., but critics including the sutton trust and the labour party argued that oxbridge’s priority should be to educate talented uk applicants, given the huge number of qualified applicants the two universities attract domestically., “our world-class universities should be there for all of us, not just the wealthiest and privileged, and urgent action is clearly needed to ensure they are open to talented students regardless of their background,” said angela rayner, the shadow education secretary., the figures for the 2017-18 academic year show that cambridge had 12,155 first degree students , just 295 more than five years earlier. of those, 9,365 were from the uk, 245 fewer than in 2012-13., the combined number of eu and other international undergraduates taking first degrees at cambridge in the same period rose by 545 to 2,790, with most of the increase coming from 420 additional international students, including many from china., oxford showed similar changes, with 420 more international students and 400 fewer british undergraduates in the same five years., figures first published by the bbc show that cambridge has reduced the number of british undergraduates by 480 since 2007-08, while oxford has reduced its intake by more than 700 in the same decade. in contrast, british universities such as bristol and exeter have increased their uk undergraduate numbers by more than 50%., an indication of oxbridge’s strong international standing came in the publication of the latest qs world university rankings by subject, which showed oxford was the highest-performing british university by taking five of the top places., oxford was named the best university in the world for english language and literature, pharmacy and pharmacology, archaeology, anthropology and geography, while cambridge took the no 1 spot for the study of anatomy and physiology., overall, the latest rankings were positive for british universities, which secured the top spot in 13 out of 48 subject areas this year, up from 10 last year., university college london took the top spot for education and the study of architecture and the built environment; sussex for development studies; the royal college of art for art and design; loughborough for sports-related subjects; the royal veterinary college for veterinary science, and the london school of economics for social policy and administration., ben sowter, a director of research at qs, said: “the research data used to compile this edition was collected between 2013 and 2018, and the impact that our imminent exit from the eu will have on uk performance is still unknown.”, the us leads the qs rankings by a considerable margin, with the uk in second place, but qs says america’s higher education performance is faltering, with the number of top rankings at subject level down from 34 last year to 28 this year., • this article was amended on 28 february 2019. an earlier version quoted figures for cambridge of “12,155 first year students for first degrees”. the figures are for all students doing first degrees, not just those in their first year.]

"this affiliation represents a commitment to patients first and a tremendous opportunity to improve the health and outcomes of those living with a rare disease.", established in 2012, the oxford rare disease initiative is a collaboration between the university of oxford and the oxford university hospitals trust, which provides the opportunity to combine preclinical and clinical expertise in areas including neurology, inflammation and immunology, hematology, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and has created an extensive rare-disease network, according to the release., also founded in 2012, harrington discovery institute — part of the harrington project for discovery &amp; development — aims to advance scientific discoveries over the drug development's "valley of death" — the stage when a new discovery is seen as promising but is insufficiently validated to attract the funding needed for clinical trials. the institute has supported more than 100 drugs-in-the-making across disease areas and academic institutions, focusing on diseases where unmet need is greatest., "our partnership with harrington discovery institute recognizes the combined experience needed in world-class science and drug development if we are to change the rare-disease landscape in a meaningful way — and oxford is committed to doing so through this unique, open model supporting the most impactful innovation throughout the u.k.," said sir john bell, regius professor of medicine at oxford, in a prepared statement., the new center is supported in part by a grant from the cleveland foundation, according to the release., "this is a phenomenal opportunity for cleveland to further distinguish itself as a leader in biomedical innovation," said cleveland foundation president and ceo ronn richard in a prepared statement.

[utc, , , the creative destruction lab is going global., the seed-stage accelerator developed at the university of toronto’s rotman school of management has struck a deal with the university of oxford’s saïd business school to bring its unique startup-building concept to entrepreneurs on the other side of the pond., once up and running, cdl-oxford will become the seventh location in cdl’s network after the program opened at new york university’s stern school of business last year., ajay agrawal, cdl’s founder and a rotman professor of strategic management, said the entire cdl network – which also includes locations at business schools in vancouver, calgary, montreal and halifax – is poised to reap the benefits of having other world-class institutions like nyu and oxford in the mix. , “what we're trying to do is identify people who are the best in the world,” he said. “they're getting our model, but we're getting connectivity and flows of people and capital into canada.”, first launched at rotman in 2012, cdl was created to solve what agrawal refers to as a “failure in the market for judgment.” he got the idea after noting that one of the key benefits afforded startups in places like silicon valley is a large network of seasoned tech executives, venture capitalists and other players who can offer budding entrepreneurs guidance and advice., cdl seeks to replicate the environment with a focus on scalable science- and technology-based ventures. the nine-month program taps a diverse array of experts, from scientists to investors, and requires entrepreneurs to meet clearly defined objectives. cdl also involves mba students, providing the startups with management expertise and students with real-life business problems to solve., the cdl concept was later expanded to business schools across canada., “the thing about the creative destruction lab that i think is unique is how it co-ordinates both across disciplines – for example, we have physicists in the same room as electrical engineers, business school students and economists – and also across the town-and-gown divide,” agrawal says., “so the entrepreneur walks into the room and receives input from a wide range of skill sets.”, so far, the cdl network has helped build startups that are collectively worth $3.4 billion in equity value., thomas hellmann, a professor at oxford’s saïd business school, called the cdl formula “very impressive” and said it made more sense for the saïd school to use an established entrepreneurship model than to invent a new one., “we're very enthusiastic about the model,” hellmann said. “in terms of big picture, this is trying to create a learning community that sits about between the university and commercial world., “each of the participants have their own motivations, but bringing them together in a way that's actually interesting for each of them is what creates the magic.”, three of those participants will be the first three founding partners at cdl-oxford: patrick pichette, a former chief financial officer at google who works with cdl-montreal through his venture capital firm inovia capital; john mccall macbain, a canadian businessman and philanthropist who founded trader classified media; and peter davies, a senior partner at investment management firm lansdowne partners and current chair of oxford sciences innovation. , hellmann, who has been tracking cdl since its inception, said cdl-oxford will start off with a focus on artificial intelligence-based startups, but has plans to expand into other areas. cdl-oxford will begin taking applications for its first cohort later this year., though agrawal never set out to build a global cdl network, he said expanding the concept to more than a half dozen locations creates more opportunities for cdl’s entrepreneurs. , “it has enabled us to match scientific discoveries and commercial applications that often are not co-located,” he said., he cites the example of validere, a startup at cdl-toronto with an “optical liquid fingerprinting” technology developed at harvard university that it planned to use to identify fraudulent perfumes. but after cdl’s fellows found the business case underwhelming, they were directed to cdl-calgary and the oil and gas industry., fast- forward to 2019 and validere now offers a real-time oil-testing service and has offices in calgary, houston and toronto. it raised $7 million from investors last fall., share this page,

, ai experts like geoff hinton, nick bostrom, and william tunstall-pedoe have all offered mentoring to students on cdl programs. , since leaving google in 2015, pichette has become a venture capital investor at inovia capital, where he's a general partner. he's now looking to back the next google's of the world. earlier this month, pichette told media that europe has the potential to build these $100 billion businesses. , pichette is also the incoming chairman of oxford sciences innovation, an organisation that aims to take oxford’s best ideas to the world. the organisation is investing over £580 million the math, physical, life sciences, medical sciences, computer sciences and engineering divisions of oxford university. it's being funded in part by google's venture capital arm, google ventures, or gv as it's known today. , professor peter tufano, dean of saïd business school, said: "with cdl we are taking the next step to support world-class scientific research and innovation across the uk and europe. this programme helps business and technical founders overcome the challenges of developing early-stage ventures into large-scale profitable organisations, by providing outstanding guidance on mission-critical aspects such as developing a commercial strategy, hiring the right people, and securing funding.", chris skidmore, the uk science and innovation minister, added: "the opportunities of artificial intelligence are endless and current innovations are already having a profound effect on our lives – from having a personal assistant on your mobile phone to websites suggesting new films you’d be interested in., "in our modern industrial strategy, we have recognised the value ai can add to our economy, creating the high skilled jobs of the future and boosting our productivity in every part of the uk. this innovative hub – the first in europe – will help our start-ups get the support they need to take their ideas to market and scale up their businesses.",  , you can follow sam shead on twitter: @sam_l_shead., i cover artificial intelligence and google deepmind. in previous roles i’ve written about tech policy, european startups, the gig economy, and venture capital. today i’m...]

https://luckbox.com/esports-news/article/oxford-university-violent-video-games-study

[an university of oxford study has revealed something gamers have long known, that there is an absence of evidence to connect use of violent games and violent behaviour in real life. the witchhunt that has long existed against gaming in an attempt to demonise the makers and user of video games has never been supported by empirical evidence, and now the opposite has been proven by one of the world’s oldest and most respected educational institutions., 
, rather than the self-reporting so many of these experiments have relied upon, this study used nationally representative data from british teens and their parents alongside official eu and us ratings of game violence. the findings were published in royal society open science, and pretty definitive in their conclusions. professor andrew przybylski, director of research at the oxford internet institute, commented on the findings, and the possible reasons this dead horse has been flogged for so very long., 
, “the idea that violent video games drive real-world aggression is a popular one, but it hasn’t tested very well over time. despite interest in the topic by parents and policy-makers, the research has not demonstrated that there is cause for concern,” przybylski was quoted as saying on the research. “part of the problem in technology research is that there are many ways to analyse the same data, which will produce different results. a cherry-picked result can add undue weight to the moral panic surrounding video games. the registered study approach is a safe-guard against this.”, 
, 
, 
, his co-author, dr netta weinstein of cardiff university, echoes the sentiment that gamers have long held, confirming that bias and prejudice is the main, if not only way you could hold the view games and real world violence were connected. “our findings suggest that researcher biases might have influenced previous studies on this topic, and have distorted our understanding of the effects of video games,” she said on the study., 
, the study used a combination of subjective and objective data to measure teen aggression and violence in games, putting it way ahead of other such ‘scientific’ studies on the topic. unlike previous research on the topic, which relied heavily on self-reported data from teenagers, the study used information from parents and carers to judge the level of aggressive behaviour in their children, rather than simply asking teenage boys and girls how angry they were., 
, whether this has a real effect remains to be seen, but one thing we can be sure of is the fact that there is no scientific link between the two phenomena, and anyone suggesting such is guilty of prejudice. what drives that hatred of gamers is another topic entirely, and maybe a good subject for oxford’s next work, but for now we’ll have to make do with empirical proof that games are not making kids angry, causing violent crime, and so on, which we all already knew, but it’s nice to be able to prove., 
, in-game toxicity is a phrase we seem to hear more and more about in 2019, as the gaming population grows in number and influence, and to be honest here at luckbox we are all in favour of making online play a nicer place to be. the occasional flash of frustration is something we’ve all experienced in-game, but those people who set out with the intent of making sure nobody else has fun are another level, and add nothing to the gaming ecosystem.

, oxford and cambridge universities are teaching nearly 1,000 fewer british undergraduates than they were five years ago, despite spending millions of pounds on programmes designed to widen participation and improve access for disadvantaged uk applicants., figures from the higher education statistics agency have shown that oxford and cambridge are almost alone among the competitive british universities in failing to expand their intake of domestic undergraduates while slowly increasing the proportion of sought-after places going to eu and international students., but the two ancient universities defended their record, saying british applicants were far more likely to win admission as undergraduates than those from overseas, despite sharp increases in the numbers of applicants of all nationalities with the necessary grades., oxford said its undergraduate makeup was part of its mission to attract and educate the most talented students from across the world. “we are committed to our role in broadening participation in higher education and doing what it takes to make the university more open and diverse, and are making headway with this work,” a university spokesperson said. “black and ethnic minority students now make up more than 18% of our undergraduate intake, while for the second year in a row more students than ever before have come to oxford from deprived areas of the uk.”, a spokesperson for cambridge said: “the university has made significant progress in all its widening participation measures over the same period. the university accepts students on merit, regardless of their background.”, figures supplied by oxford showed that uk applicants are far more likely to be offered a place compared with their eu and non-eu peers. nearly one in four uk applicants – 23% - were made an offer, compared with one in 10 non-eu applicants and one in eight eu applicants., but critics including the sutton trust and the labour party argued that oxbridge’s priority should be to educate talented uk applicants, given the huge number of qualified applicants the two universities attract domestically., “our world-class universities should be there for all of us, not just the wealthiest and privileged, and urgent action is clearly needed to ensure they are open to talented students regardless of their background,” said angela rayner, the shadow education secretary., the figures for the 2017-18 academic year show that cambridge had 12,155 first degree students , just 295 more than five years earlier. of those, 9,365 were from the uk, 245 fewer than in 2012-13., the combined number of eu and other international undergraduates taking first degrees at cambridge in the same period rose by 545 to 2,790, with most of the increase coming from 420 additional international students, including many from china., oxford showed similar changes, with 420 more international students and 400 fewer british undergraduates in the same five years., figures first published by the bbc show that cambridge has reduced the number of british undergraduates by 480 since 2007-08, while oxford has reduced its intake by more than 700 in the same decade. in contrast, british universities such as bristol and exeter have increased their uk undergraduate numbers by more than 50%., an indication of oxbridge’s strong international standing came in the publication of the latest qs world university rankings by subject, which showed oxford was the highest-performing british university by taking five of the top places., oxford was named the best university in the world for english language and literature, pharmacy and pharmacology, archaeology, anthropology and geography, while cambridge took the no 1 spot for the study of anatomy and physiology., overall, the latest rankings were positive for british universities, which secured the top spot in 13 out of 48 subject areas this year, up from 10 last year., university college london took the top spot for education and the study of architecture and the built environment; sussex for development studies; the royal college of art for art and design; loughborough for sports-related subjects; the royal veterinary college for veterinary science, and the london school of economics for social policy and administration., ben sowter, a director of research at qs, said: “the research data used to compile this edition was collected between 2013 and 2018, and the impact that our imminent exit from the eu will have on uk performance is still unknown.”, the us leads the qs rankings by a considerable margin, with the uk in second place, but qs says america’s higher education performance is faltering, with the number of top rankings at subject level down from 34 last year to 28 this year., • this article was amended on 28 february 2019. an earlier version quoted figures for cambridge of “12,155 first year students for first degrees”. the figures are for all students doing first degrees, not just those in their first year.]

"this affiliation represents a commitment to patients first and a tremendous opportunity to improve the health and outcomes of those living with a rare disease.", established in 2012, the oxford rare disease initiative is a collaboration between the university of oxford and the oxford university hospitals trust, which provides the opportunity to combine preclinical and clinical expertise in areas including neurology, inflammation and immunology, hematology, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and has created an extensive rare-disease network, according to the release., also founded in 2012, harrington discovery institute — part of the harrington project for discovery &amp; development — aims to advance scientific discoveries over the drug development's "valley of death" — the stage when a new discovery is seen as promising but is insufficiently validated to attract the funding needed for clinical trials. the institute has supported more than 100 drugs-in-the-making across disease areas and academic institutions, focusing on diseases where unmet need is greatest., "our partnership with harrington discovery institute recognizes the combined experience needed in world-class science and drug development if we are to change the rare-disease landscape in a meaningful way — and oxford is committed to doing so through this unique, open model supporting the most impactful innovation throughout the u.k.," said sir john bell, regius professor of medicine at oxford, in a prepared statement., the new center is supported in part by a grant from the cleveland foundation, according to the release., "this is a phenomenal opportunity for cleveland to further distinguish itself as a leader in biomedical innovation," said cleveland foundation president and ceo ronn richard in a prepared statement.

[utc, , , the creative destruction lab is going global., the seed-stage accelerator developed at the university of toronto’s rotman school of management has struck a deal with the university of oxford’s saïd business school to bring its unique startup-building concept to entrepreneurs on the other side of the pond., once up and running, cdl-oxford will become the seventh location in cdl’s network after the program opened at new york university’s stern school of business last year., ajay agrawal, cdl’s founder and a rotman professor of strategic management, said the entire cdl network – which also includes locations at business schools in vancouver, calgary, montreal and halifax – is poised to reap the benefits of having other world-class institutions like nyu and oxford in the mix. , “what we're trying to do is identify people who are the best in the world,” he said. “they're getting our model, but we're getting connectivity and flows of people and capital into canada.”, first launched at rotman in 2012, cdl was created to solve what agrawal refers to as a “failure in the market for judgment.” he got the idea after noting that one of the key benefits afforded startups in places like silicon valley is a large network of seasoned tech executives, venture capitalists and other players who can offer budding entrepreneurs guidance and advice., cdl seeks to replicate the environment with a focus on scalable science- and technology-based ventures. the nine-month program taps a diverse array of experts, from scientists to investors, and requires entrepreneurs to meet clearly defined objectives. cdl also involves mba students, providing the startups with management expertise and students with real-life business problems to solve., the cdl concept was later expanded to business schools across canada., “the thing about the creative destruction lab that i think is unique is how it co-ordinates both across disciplines – for example, we have physicists in the same room as electrical engineers, business school students and economists – and also across the town-and-gown divide,” agrawal says., “so the entrepreneur walks into the room and receives input from a wide range of skill sets.”, so far, the cdl network has helped build startups that are collectively worth $3.4 billion in equity value., thomas hellmann, a professor at oxford’s saïd business school, called the cdl formula “very impressive” and said it made more sense for the saïd school to use an established entrepreneurship model than to invent a new one., “we're very enthusiastic about the model,” hellmann said. “in terms of big picture, this is trying to create a learning community that sits about between the university and commercial world., “each of the participants have their own motivations, but bringing them together in a way that's actually interesting for each of them is what creates the magic.”, three of those participants will be the first three founding partners at cdl-oxford: patrick pichette, a former chief financial officer at google who works with cdl-montreal through his venture capital firm inovia capital; john mccall macbain, a canadian businessman and philanthropist who founded trader classified media; and peter davies, a senior partner at investment management firm lansdowne partners and current chair of oxford sciences innovation. , hellmann, who has been tracking cdl since its inception, said cdl-oxford will start off with a focus on artificial intelligence-based startups, but has plans to expand into other areas. cdl-oxford will begin taking applications for its first cohort later this year., though agrawal never set out to build a global cdl network, he said expanding the concept to more than a half dozen locations creates more opportunities for cdl’s entrepreneurs. , “it has enabled us to match scientific discoveries and commercial applications that often are not co-located,” he said., he cites the example of validere, a startup at cdl-toronto with an “optical liquid fingerprinting” technology developed at harvard university that it planned to use to identify fraudulent perfumes. but after cdl’s fellows found the business case underwhelming, they were directed to cdl-calgary and the oil and gas industry., fast- forward to 2019 and validere now offers a real-time oil-testing service and has offices in calgary, houston and toronto. it raised $7 million from investors last fall., share this page,

, ai experts like geoff hinton, nick bostrom, and william tunstall-pedoe have all offered mentoring to students on cdl programs. , since leaving google in 2015, pichette has become a venture capital investor at inovia capital, where he's a general partner. he's now looking to back the next google's of the world. earlier this month, pichette told media that europe has the potential to build these $100 billion businesses. , pichette is also the incoming chairman of oxford sciences innovation, an organisation that aims to take oxford’s best ideas to the world. the organisation is investing over £580 million the math, physical, life sciences, medical sciences, computer sciences and engineering divisions of oxford university. it's being funded in part by google's venture capital arm, google ventures, or gv as it's known today. , professor peter tufano, dean of saïd business school, said: "with cdl we are taking the next step to support world-class scientific research and innovation across the uk and europe. this programme helps business and technical founders overcome the challenges of developing early-stage ventures into large-scale profitable organisations, by providing outstanding guidance on mission-critical aspects such as developing a commercial strategy, hiring the right people, and securing funding.", chris skidmore, the uk science and innovation minister, added: "the opportunities of artificial intelligence are endless and current innovations are already having a profound effect on our lives – from having a personal assistant on your mobile phone to websites suggesting new films you’d be interested in., "in our modern industrial strategy, we have recognised the value ai can add to our economy, creating the high skilled jobs of the future and boosting our productivity in every part of the uk. this innovative hub – the first in europe – will help our start-ups get the support they need to take their ideas to market and scale up their businesses.",  , you can follow sam shead on twitter: @sam_l_shead., i cover artificial intelligence and google deepmind. in previous roles i’ve written about tech policy, european startups, the gig economy, and venture capital. today i’m...]

https://luckbox.com/esports-news/article/oxford-university-violent-video-games-study

[an university of oxford study has revealed something gamers have long known, that there is an absence of evidence to connect use of violent games and violent behaviour in real life. the witchhunt that has long existed against gaming in an attempt to demonise the makers and user of video games has never been supported by empirical evidence, and now the opposite has been proven by one of the world’s oldest and most respected educational institutions., 
, rather than the self-reporting so many of these experiments have relied upon, this study used nationally representative data from british teens and their parents alongside official eu and us ratings of game violence. the findings were published in royal society open science, and pretty definitive in their conclusions. professor andrew przybylski, director of research at the oxford internet institute, commented on the findings, and the possible reasons this dead horse has been flogged for so very long., 
, “the idea that violent video games drive real-world aggression is a popular one, but it hasn’t tested very well over time. despite interest in the topic by parents and policy-makers, the research has not demonstrated that there is cause for concern,” przybylski was quoted as saying on the research. “part of the problem in technology research is that there are many ways to analyse the same data, which will produce different results. a cherry-picked result can add undue weight to the moral panic surrounding video games. the registered study approach is a safe-guard against this.”, 
, 
, 
, his co-author, dr netta weinstein of cardiff university, echoes the sentiment that gamers have long held, confirming that bias and prejudice is the main, if not only way you could hold the view games and real world violence were connected. “our findings suggest that researcher biases might have influenced previous studies on this topic, and have distorted our understanding of the effects of video games,” she said on the study., 
, the study used a combination of subjective and objective data to measure teen aggression and violence in games, putting it way ahead of other such ‘scientific’ studies on the topic. unlike previous research on the topic, which relied heavily on self-reported data from teenagers, the study used information from parents and carers to judge the level of aggressive behaviour in their children, rather than simply asking teenage boys and girls how angry they were., 
, whether this has a real effect remains to be seen, but one thing we can be sure of is the fact that there is no scientific link between the two phenomena, and anyone suggesting such is guilty of prejudice. what drives that hatred of gamers is another topic entirely, and maybe a good subject for oxford’s next work, but for now we’ll have to make do with empirical proof that games are not making kids angry, causing violent crime, and so on, which we all already knew, but it’s nice to be able to prove., 
, in-game toxicity is a phrase we seem to hear more and more about in 2019, as the gaming population grows in number and influence, and to be honest here at luckbox we are all in favour of making online play a nicer place to be. the occasional flash of frustration is something we’ve all experienced in-game, but those people who set out with the intent of making sure nobody else has fun are another level, and add nothing to the gaming ecosystem.
